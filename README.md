# Handwritten Digits Recognition using Scikit-Learn

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the `digits` dataset from `sklearn.datasets` to perform optical recognition of handwritten digits. It involves data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing techniques to understand and analyze the dataset.

## Features
- Loads the `digits` dataset containing 8x8 pixel images of handwritten numbers (0-9)
- Displays dataset properties including images, target labels, and feature names
- Utilizes popular Python libraries for data analysis and visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the provided code.
